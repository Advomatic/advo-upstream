# TYPICALLY: You'll be testing a completed feature branch compared to master.  In this case you'll compare a multi-dev

domains:
  # If a Pantheon domain is protected with HTTP authentication then use the format:

  # For Lando
  # * until v3.0.0-beta.35 at least, you can't use HTTPS
  # * the domain must match what was reported when Lando started.
  #
  # Change the key to something more meaningful (e.g. multidev, or lando)

  domain2: "https://multidev-stanford-hs.pantheonsite.io"

# You may override the "fuzz" configured in the main config file.
# A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.

# To only test a single path, rather than the list of paths in the imported
