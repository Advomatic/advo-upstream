# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
browser: "phantomjs"

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  # to test against an environment that is password-protected, use the following as 'current' below:
  #  "https://{username}:{password}@test-aclu-d7.pantheonsite.io
  test-site:  "https://test-advomatic.pantheonsite.io"
  multi-dev:  "https://dev-advomatic.pantheonsite.io"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
paths:
  home:                           /

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
# @todo Looks like we need to manually specify a height here due to https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith/issues/318
screen_widths:
  - 320x5000
  - 768x5000
  - 1280x5000

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
before_capture: 'javascript/wait--phantom.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'shots'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '10%'

# (optional) The maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images before Wraith reports a failure. Default: 0
# threshold: 5

# (optional) Specify the template (and generated thumbnail sizes) for the gallery output.
gallery:
  template: 'basic_template'
  thumb_width:  200
  thumb_height: 200

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_only
