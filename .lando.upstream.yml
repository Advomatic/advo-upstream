      Process a CSV file of URLs through WAVE.  E.g.
        lando wave my.csv Rk3fKE231077
      1. You might generate the CSV file with Screaming Frog.
      2. If you want to keep things _real_ simple, just create a blank file and
         put one URL per line.
      3. The CSV file must exist within the project codebase.
      4. You don't _really_ need Lando to run this.  You can call the script
         directly:
          ./tests/wave/wave-csv-test ~/path/to/some.csv Rk3fKE231077

    cmd:
      - /app/tests/wave/wave-csv-test
